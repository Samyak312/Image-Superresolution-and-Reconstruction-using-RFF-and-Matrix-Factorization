# Image-Superresolution-and-Reconstruction-using-RFF-and-Matrix-Factorization
Applied Random Fourier Features (RFF) for superresolution, enhancing image resolution by a factor of 2. Conducted both qualitative and quantitative comparisons using RMSE and Peak SNR metrics.Utilized RFF to reconstruct images with varying percentages of missing data (10-90 %). Evaluated performance using
RMSE and Peak SNR, and compared results with matrix factorization methods.
